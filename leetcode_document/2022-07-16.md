148. Sort List(Medium, Finished: 1)
     Solution: use merge sort, first find the middle point of the linked list, then sort it by its value.
     use two helper function 

    There is a detail in fast and slow pointer. slow= 0, fast= 0 or 1, the value of fast will affect the output
    in even length array. fast = 0 will end in n/2  fast = 1 will end in (n/2)+1 
    Please be aware of that 

56. Merge Intervals(Medium, Finished: 1)
    Solution: first sort the array by the start value, if the next interval's start less than previous end. then merge
    else push to the result array 

27. Remove Element(Medium, Finished: 3)
    Solution: use two pointer

179. Largest Number(Medium, Finished: 1)
    Solution: there are only two ways that two number are arranged together, either ab or ba, so sort the array by this way

75. Sort Colors(Medium, Finished: 1)
    Solution: since there are only 3 numbers needed to be sorted, I can use a hashmap to store the frequency of them
    and then push them into the array in order. 
    Hashmap seems to be created by order.
