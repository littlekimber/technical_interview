1254. Number of Closed Islands(Medium, Finished: 2)
Solution: Use dfs to destory the corner island at first, then the same step as No.200

Thinking: What is the time complexity and space complexity of this algorithm? 

Answer: for the mxn matrix, the time complexity should be O(mxn) since it will go over each element 
and the space complexity should also be O(mxn)
In traversing the tree the space complexity should be o(h) where h represents the max height of the tree

1905. Count Sub Islands(Medium, Finished: 1)
Solution: Find the case that which kind of islands should not be sub island, then same as No.200

695. Max Area of Island(Medium, Finished: 1)
Solution: the key is to return the area of the island, set the return value of recursive funtion 
base case: return 0  else reutrn dfs + dfs + dfs + dfs + 1(上下左右中间就是岛屿面积) res = Math.max(res, dfs())更新数据
