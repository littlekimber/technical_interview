215. Kth Largest Element in an Array(Medium, Finished:1)
    Solution: about k-th min max can use quick select algorithm 
    recursion, set the left(min) right(max) value as pivot 
    swap the p and i element if nums[i]<=p(max)
    the essence of this algorithm is to find the k index, we can set it differently from max to min
